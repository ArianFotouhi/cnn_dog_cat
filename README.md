## A CNNs based binary image classifier of cat and dog images.

#### In preprocessing, the batch size is set to 32 and image shape is set to 64*64

#### The model is based on TensorFlow CNNs and after the CNNs processing, the data is flattened for fully connected layers

#### By sigmoid activation function the output is represented

#### Adam Optimizer and Binary Cross Entropy loss is applied then trained for 50 epochs
